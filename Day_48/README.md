/*
* Question 142: Create a Promise that resolves with "Hello, World!" after 2 seconds.

* Explain & TIP: Promises in JavaScript are used for asynchronous computations and can be in 
* one of these states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. A Promise that resolves after a delay 
* demonstrates how to handle operations that take some time to complete, like fetching data or timing events.
*/

/*
* Question 144: Explain the use of the Promise.all() method with an example.

* Explain & TIP: Promise.all() takes an iterable of Promises and returns a single Promise 
* that resolves when all of the Promises in the iterable have resolved or when the iterable 
* contains no Promises. It is rejected if any of the passed Promises are rejected. 
* This method is useful for aggregating the results of multiple promises.
*/

/*
* Question 143: Show how to use the .then() and .catch() methods to handle Promise resolution and rejection.

* Explain & TIP: The .then() method is called when a Promise is successfully resolved, while .catch() 
* is called when a Promise is rejected. Together, they provide a powerful and readable way to 
* handle asynchronous success and error scenarios.
