/*
* Question 22: Intentional Error: Try to produce an array index error in one of your programs. 
* Correct the error before finishing.

* Explain & TIP: Array index errors happen when you try to access a position in the array that doesnâ€™t exist. 
* Experimenting with this helps you understand array boundaries.
*/

/*
* Question 24: More Conditional Tests: Expand your conditional tests to cover a wider range of comparisons.

* Explain & TIP: Experiment with different types of conditions to see how they work. 
* This builds a deeper understanding of logic in programming.
*/

/*
* Question 23: Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Predict the results of each test.

* Explain & TIP: Conditional tests check if something is true or false. 
* Writing different tests helps you understand how conditions work in programming.
