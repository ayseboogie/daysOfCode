/*
* Question 3: Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, 
* and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
* Use "\t" (tab) and "\n" (new line) at least once. 
* Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
* Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.
