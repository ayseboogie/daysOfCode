/*
* Question 145: Create a function that accepts a callback and invokes it with some arguments.

* Explain & TIP: Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to another function. 
* This design pattern is very common in JavaScript for asynchronous operations, event listeners, 
* or to customize the behavior of a function with custom actions.
*/

/*
* Question 147: Explain how to handle errors in a callback pattern.

* Explain & TIP: Handling errors in a callback pattern often involves passing an error as 
* the first argument to the callback. This convention allows the callback function to check 
* for errors before proceeding with its execution.
*/

/*
* Question 146: Show an example of a callback function used to filter an array of numbers.

* Explain & TIP: The .filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test 
* implemented by the provided function. This method is commonly used to search through an array 
* and create a subset of it based on certain criteria.
